They quickly realized that saving this information in .csv format will not meet their needs as they grow. First, consider how you would design a relational database to meet their needs. Be sure to consider conventions of normalization and what information should be separated."

    "- Each user should have a first name, last name, and email.\n",
    "-We will be saving a list of each user's favorite books.\n",
    "- Each book should have a title and an author. (The author's whole name can be one attribute)\n",
    "-Note that each user will have multiple favorite books, and a book could certainly be the favorite of many users.\n",
    "- Use the MySQL Workbench for designing the ERD.\n",
    "- Hint: When you link two tables with a many to many relationship, MySQL Workbench will automatically create a joiner table for you! It will also automatically make the keys primary keys, which you will want to uncheck.\n",
    "- Insert the image of your ERD into the first markdown cell of your Jupyter Notebook. Use the example markdown syntax for inserting an image."
